# React Components

This directory contains all React components for the org-social-viewer web application, organized into two main categories.

## Component Architecture

### Core Components (`core/`)
Core components handle the main application logic, state management, and data coordination. These components form the backbone of the application and manage complex interactions between different parts of the system.

### UI Components (`ui/`)  
UI components are reusable presentation components that focus on user interface elements and interactions. They handle visual display and user experience rather than application logic.

## Styling

Each component has an associated CSS Module file (`.module.css`) providing:
- Component-scoped styles
- Responsive design patterns
- Consistent theming and typography
- Animation and transition effects

## Documentation

For detailed component documentation, see:
- **[Core Components](core/README.md)** - Application logic and state management
- **[UI Components](ui/README.md)** - User interface and presentation components
